# Nihotip

Nihotip is a web application designed to help users explore the intricacies of the Japanese language through a dynamic
and interactive interface. With a React frontend and a Python backend, Nihotip provides a convenient way to tokenize
Japanese text and delve into detailed information about words, symbols, and their respective properties via tooltips.
Nihotip offers a robust solution for analyzing Japanese text at multiple levels of granularity.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Japanese Text Tokenization:**
  Input Japanese text and have it automatically tokenized into words and symbols.

- **Detailed Word and Symbol Insights:**
  Hover over words or symbols to access detailed tooltips that explain the structure, readings, and associated
  properties of each token.

- **Level-based Token Breakdown:**
  Nihotip organizes tokenized text into multiple hierarchical levels for easy navigation (features of different levels
  of tokens are listed inside brackets):
    - text
        - not a japanese word
            - punctuation
            - space
            - line break
            - string of not japanese characters
        - japanese word (part of speech)
            - **part by reading**
                - one or multiple kanji (kana reading -> **part by reading**)
                - digraph
                    - **big kana without tenten**
                    - **big kana with tenten**
                    - small kana (_respective_ **big kana**)
                - **kana without tenten** (romaji, association)
                - **kana with tenten** (_respective_ **kana without tenten**)

- **part by reading:**

  _Parts are gotten by cutting the reading of the word. They allow to determine the kana reading for each kanji. A part
  consists of multiple characters if the reading of a kanji along with the characters surrounding it can't be cut. For
  example, the part "Â§ß‰∫∫" of the word "Â§ß‰∫∫Ë≤∑„ÅÑ" uses a special reading "„Åä„Å®„Å™" that can't be cut. That's why the "„Åä„Å®„Å™"
  reading applies to the whole part._

- **syllable:**

    - single kana
    - digraph
    - kana with "„Å£", "„ÉÉ" or "„Éº"
    - single kanji

- **Tooltip insights:**
  Show how readings map to individual characters and provide additional details like romaji and kana associations.
